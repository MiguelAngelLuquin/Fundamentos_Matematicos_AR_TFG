# Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Final Degree Project

This repository contains the code developed for the final undergraduate thesis in Mathematics at the University of Zaragoza. The project focuses on the mathematical foundations of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, with a special emphasis on the **Q-learning** algorithm and its deep learning extensions.

The implementations demonstrate how RL can be applied to different environments of increasing complexity.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories, each corresponding to a practical case study analyzed in the thesis:

- [`FrozenLake/`](./FrozenLake):  
  Classical Q-learning applied to the Frozen Lake environment. Includes a basic implementation and experimentation with different hyperparameters.

- [`tictactoe_qlearning/`](./tictactoe_qlearning):  
  Custom Q-learning implementation for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The agent trains through self-play to learn an optimal strategy.

- [`CartPole-DQN/`](./CartPole-DQN):  
  Deep Q-learning using a neural network to balance a pole on a moving cart (CartPole environment). Implements experience replay, target networks, and training routines using PyTorch.

## üß† Topics Covered

- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Bellman equations
- Tabular Q-learning
- Exploration vs. Exploitation (Œµ-greedy strategies)
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with function approximation
- Empirical analysis of convergence and hyperparameter tuning

## üöÄ Requirements

Install dependencies (example for Python projects):

```bash
pip install gymnasium torch numpy
